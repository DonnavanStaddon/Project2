            <p>
                Responsive web design makes your web page look good on all devices. Designing 
                For The Best Experience For All Users Web pages can be viewed using many 
                different devices: desktops, tablets, and phones. Your web page should look
                good, and be easy to use, regardless of the device. Web pages should not 
                leave out information to fit smaller devices, but rather adapt its content to 
                fit any device.
